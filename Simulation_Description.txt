The “base game” class (created by Meera) follows Conway’s Game of Life rules, with the initial birth of cells being randomized completely across the grid (the initial setup displays all cells at once) and the game rules are applied from then on. The “birth” class (created by Robert) also follows the Game of Life rules, except birth of cells are constantly being randomized across the grid. The rules begin to apply when cells arbitrarily come into contact with one another. The “competition” class (created by Isai) is composed of two types of cells (red and blue). Like the “base game” setup, the initial grid of live cells is completely randomized. The addition here is that the randomization is a 3-way chance between death, a red cell, and a blue cell (whereas the “base game” contains only a binary choice of alive or dead). The same rules apply, but cells can only interact with cells of the same color (red with red, blue with blue).
